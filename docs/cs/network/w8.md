### Middleware Requirements

```
Distributed System Components
├── Application Layer
├── Middleware Layer
│   ├── Transaction Monitors
│   ├── Data Converters
│   └── Communication Controllers
└── Network Infrastructure
```

*   Middleware software (like transaction monitors, data converters, communication controllers) may be needed to manage and support components in a distributed system.

## 2. Client-Server Architecture

*   A primary distributed systems architecture.
*   Consists of a set of **servers that provide specific services** (like printing, data management) and a set of **clients that call on these services**.

• Web browser interface
• ATM interface

Application Processing (Server):
• Account management service
• Transaction processing
• Security validation
• Business rule enforcement

Data Management (Server):

```

### Calculation Example: Server Load Distribution

**Scenario**: 1000 concurrent users, 3-tier architecture

```
Load Distribution Calculation:

Presentation Tier (Client-side):
• UI rendering: 1000 clients × 10% CPU = Local processing
• Network requests: 1000 × 5 requests/min = 5000 requests/min

Application Tier:
• Request processing: 5000 requests/min ÷ 3 servers = 1667 requests/server/min
• Business logic: 60% of total processing load

Data Tier:
• Database queries: 5000 requests/min × 0.8 DB ratio = 4000 queries/min
• Storage I/O: 40% of total processing load
```

## 5. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

### SOA vs Client-Server Paradigm Shift

| Dimension | Client-Server | SOA | Key Difference |
|-----------|---------------|-----|----------------|
| **Primary Focus** | Entity interaction | Service provisioning | Relationship vs. Function |

| **Service Binding** | Compile-time | Runtime (potential) | Fixed vs. Flexible |
| **Resource Model** | Server ownership | Service consumption | Ownership vs. Usage |
| **Scalability** | Server addition | Service composition | Hardware vs. Logic |

### SOA Component Architecture

```
SOA Interaction Flow:

1. Service Provider ──publishes──► Service Registry
                                      │
2. Service Requester ──discovers──────┘
                     │
3.                   └──requests service──► Service Provider
                                              │
4.                   ◄──service response─────┘
```

### Service Characteristics Matrix

| Characteristic | Impact | Implementation | Benefit |
|----------------|--------|----------------|---------|
| **Provider Independence** | Vendor flexibility | Standard interfaces | Reduced lock-in |
| **Runtime Service Finding** | Dynamic discovery | Registry protocols | Adaptive systems |
| **Service Composition** | Modularity | API orchestration | Rapid development |
| **Pay-per-use Model** | Cost optimization | Usage metering | Resource efficiency |
| **Compact Applications** | Reduced complexity | Microservices | Maintainability |
| **Reactive/Adaptive** | Dynamic behavior | Event-driven design | Responsiveness |

### Hybrid Implementation Example

```
E-commerce Platform: SOA + Client-Server Hybrid

Client-Server Components:
├── Web Frontend (Client)
├── Application Server
└── Database Server

SOA Services:
├── Payment Processing Service (External)
├── Shipping Calculation Service (External)
├── Inventory Management Service (Internal)
└── User Authentication Service (Shared)

Service Registry:
• API Gateway managing service discovery
• Load balancing across service instances
• Health monitoring and failover
```

### Cost-Performance Analysis

| Architecture | Setup Cost | Operating Cost | Flexibility | Performance |
|-------------|------------|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Pure Client-Server** | Low | Medium | Low | High |
| **Pure SOA** | High | Variable | High | Variable |
| **Hybrid Approach** | Medium | Medium | High | Optimized |

### Calculation Example: SOA Service Costs

**Scenario**: E-commerce platform with SOA services

```
Monthly Service Cost Calculation:

Internal Services (Fixed costs):
• User Management: $500/month
• Inventory System: $800/month
• Order Processing: $600/month
Total Internal: $1,900/month

External Services (Usage-based):
• Payment Processing: $0.30 per transaction
• Shipping API: $0.05 per lookup
• Email Service: $0.001 per email

Usage Example (10,000 transactions/month):
• Payment: 10,000 × $0.30 = $3,000
• Shipping: 10,000 × $0.05 = $500
• Email: 15,000 × $0.001 = $15
Total External: $3,515/month

Total SOA Cost: $1,900 + $3,515 = $5,415/month

Traditional equivalent infrastructure: $8,000/month
Cost saving: $2,585/month (32% reduction)
```

### Architecture Decision Framework

| Factor | Client-Server Best | SOA Best | Hybrid Recommended |
|--------|-------------------|----------|-------------------|
| **Project Size** | Small-Medium | Large-Enterprise | Medium-Large |
| **Team Expertise** | Traditional IT | DevOps/Cloud | Mixed skills |
| **Budget Constraints** | Limited upfront | Flexible operating | Balanced approach |
| **Change Frequency** | Stable requirements | Dynamic needs | Moderate changes |
| **Integration Needs** | Internal systems | External partners | Mixed requirements |

## Exam-Focused Summary

### Critical Decision Points for Concept Questions

#### Architecture Selection Criteria

| Requirement | Recommended Architecture | Justification |
|-------------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Low latency, high performance** | Fat Client (2-tier) | Local processing reduces network overhead |
| **Centralized data control** | Thin Client (2-tier) | All logic and data on server |
| **Independent scaling needs** | Three-tier | Separate scaling of presentation, logic, data |
| **External service integration** | SOA | Registry-based discovery and composition |
| **Limited client resources** | Thin Client | Minimal client-side requirements |
| **Offline capability needed** | Fat Client | Local processing when disconnected |

### Performance Calculation Formulas

#### Network Load Calculation

```
Total Network Traffic = (Requests/second) × (Average Request Size) × (Number of Clients)

Thin Client: High network traffic (all processing remote)
Fat Client: Lower network traffic (local processing)
Three-tier: Optimized traffic (processing layer filters requests)
```

#### Scalability Metrics

```
Scalability Factor = (Max Supported Users) / (Min Infrastructure Cost)

Client-Server: Linear scaling (add servers)
SOA: Exponential scaling (service composition)
```

#### Cost-Benefit Analysis

```
TCO = Infrastructure Cost + Development Cost + Maintenance Cost + Operating Cost

ROI = (Benefits - Total Costs) / Total Costs × 100%
```

### Key Formulas for Calculations

#### Load Distribution (Three-tier)

```
Client Load = UI Processing + User Interaction
Application Server Load = Business Logic + API Processing
Database Load = Query Processing + Data Storage

Total System Load = Sum of all tier loads
Bottleneck Tier = Tier with highest utilization ratio
```

#### Service Cost Optimization (SOA)

```
Service Cost = Fixed Cost + (Usage × Variable Rate)
Total SOA Cost = Σ(Individual Service Costs)
Break-even Point = Fixed Infrastructure Cost / Monthly SOA Savings
```

#### Fault Tolerance Calculation

```
System Availability = Π(Individual Component Availability)
MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures) = 1 / Failure Rate
Recovery Time = Detection Time + Switchover Time + Sync Time
```
