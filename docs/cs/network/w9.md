* **Layers 4-5 downwards** primarily focus on **performance-related metrics**

## 4. Network Structure (Graph Theory Metrics)

### Graph Theory Foundations

A network can be viewed as a **graph**, consisting of **nodes** (devices) and **edges** (connections). Graph theory concepts can be applied to understand network structure.

### Key Metrics Comparison and Calculation

| Metric | Formula | Range | Interpretation | Use Case |
|--------|---------|--------|----------------|----------|
| **Degree Distribution P(k)** | P(k) = Nk / N | [0, 1] | Probability of k connections | Network resilience analysis |
| **Distance (Shortest Path)** | Count of edges in shortest path | [1, ∞] | Communication efficiency | Latency prediction |
| **Diameter** | max(distance(i, j)) for all pairs | [1, ∞] | Worst-case path length | Network span analysis |
| **Average Path Length** | Σdistance(i, j) / total_pairs | [1, diameter] | Typical communication cost | Overall efficiency |
| **Clustering Coefficient** | Ci = 2Ei / (ki(ki-1)) | [0, 1] | Local interconnectedness | Local efficiency |

### Worked Example: Clustering Coefficient Calculation

**Given Network:**

```
Node A connects to: B, C, D
Node B connects to: A, C
Node C connects to: A, B, D  
Node D connects to: A, C
```

**For Node A:**
* Degree (kA) = 3 (connects to B, C, D)
* Neighbors: B, C, D
* Edges between neighbors (EA): B-C, C-D = 2 edges
* CA = 2EA / (kA(kA-1)) = 2(2) / (3×2) = 4/6 = 0.67

**Interpretation:** Node A's neighbors are 67% interconnected, indicating good local connectivity.

### Network Characteristics Patterns

**Typical Large Network Properties:**
* **Degree Distribution:** Many nodes have low degree, few have very high degree (scale-free)
* **Path Properties:** Short average path lengths despite large network size (small-world)
* **Clustering:** Higher than random networks due to local community structures

## 5. Internet Topology Measurement (Levels)

### Topology Abstraction Levels

Topology measurement aims to **model the Internet accurately** and observe trends in interconnectivity across different conceptual levels:

```
Internet Topology Hierarchy

AS Level (Autonomous Systems)
├── Focus: Inter-organizational connections
├── Granularity: ISPs, corporations, universities
├── Applications: Policy analysis, economic modeling
└── Dependencies: Relies on router-level information

        ↕ Information Flow ↕

Router/Logical Level  
├── Focus: Information flow paths
├── Granularity: Individual routers and links
├── Applications: Performance optimization, routing
└── Dependencies: Relies on physical connectivity

        ↕ Information Flow ↕

Physical Level
├── Focus: Actual infrastructure  
├── Granularity: Cables, devices, geographic locations
├── Applications: Reliability analysis, capacity planning
└── Dependencies: Hardware monitoring and geographic data
```

### Level Comparison Matrix

| Aspect | Physical Level | Router Level | AS Level |
|--------|---------------|--------------|----------|
| **Entities** | Cables, devices | Routers, logical links | Organizations, ISPs |
| **Analysis Focus** | Infrastructure reliability | Protocol performance | Economic relationships |
| **Failure Impact** | Component outages | Routing disruptions | Policy changes |
| **Measurement Tools** | Hardware monitoring | Protocol analysis | BGP data, agreements |
| **Timescale** | Hardware lifecycles | Protocol updates | Business relationships |

**Key Principle:** As you move up the layers (Physical → AS), you **rely on information from lower layers** and become **less concerned with their specific details**.

```

### SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) Analysis

**SNMP Framework:**
* **Purpose:** Network management services for data collection and configuration
* **Structure:** Management Information Base (MIB) defines data organization
* **Operation:** Router polling for counter data (bytes, packets)
* **Applications:** Billing, anomaly detection, trend analysis

**SNMP Capabilities vs Limitations:**

| Capability | Description | Limitation | Impact |
|------------|-------------|------------|---------|
| **Counter Collection** | Byte/packet counts per interface | **Aggregate Data Only** | Cannot identify traffic types |
| **Periodic Polling** | Regular data collection (e.g., 5 min) | **Limited Granularity** | May miss short-term events |
| **Anomaly Detection** | Identify unusual traffic patterns | **No Traffic Details** | Cannot determine attack types |
| **Trend Analysis** | Long-term usage patterns | **No Source/Destination** | Limited security analysis |

**MRTG (Multi Router Traffic Grapher):**
* Visualizes SNMP data as time series plots
* Effective for identifying bandwidth anomalies and trends
* Can indicate security issues (e.g., DDoS attacks) through traffic spikes

## 7. Flow and Traffic Matrix Concepts

### Flow Analysis Framework

To understand network behavior comprehensively, we need to analyze **traffic flow** patterns beyond simple SNMP counters.

### Flow Definition and Characteristics

**Flow:** A **unidirectional stream of packets** between source and destination with specific identifying characteristics:

```
Flow Identification Parameters:
├── Network Layer (Layer 3)
│   ├── Source IP Address
│   ├── Destination IP Address  
│   └── Protocol Type (TCP/UDP/ICMP)
├── Transport Layer (Layer 4)
│   ├── Source Port Number
│   └── Destination Port Number
└── Interface Information
    └── Input Interface ID
```

### Flow vs SNMP Comparison

| Aspect | SNMP Counters | Flow Records |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| **Granularity** | Interface-level aggregates | Per-connection details |
| **Traffic Visibility** | Total bytes/packets | Application-specific flows |
| **Analysis Capability** | Bandwidth trends | Application breakdown |
| **Protocol Support** | Interface-agnostic | Protocol-aware |
| **Security Analysis** | Basic anomaly detection | Detailed attack analysis |

### Flow Record Structure and Applications

**Flow Record Components:**
* **Identification:** Source/destination IPs, ports, protocol
* **Counters:** Byte and packet counts per flow
* **Protocol Data:** TCP flags, ToS bits
* **Timing:** First and last packet timestamps
* **Interface:** Ingress interface information

**Protocol-Specific Considerations:**
* **TCP Flows:** Connection-oriented, easier to track (clear start/end)
* **UDP Flows:** Connectionless, may take different routes, harder to track

### Traffic Matrix Construction

**Traffic Matrix:** Represents **data transmission volumes between every pair of network nodes (subnets)**

```
Traffic Matrix Example (simplified):

        Destination Subnets
        A    B    C    D
Source A [0   15   8    3 ]  Gbps
Subnets B [12   0   22   7 ]
        C [5    18   0   11]  
        D [9    4    6    0 ]
```

**Applications:**
* **Application Breakdown:** Identify traffic by service (web traffic via TCP port 80)
* **Flow Counting:** Monitor active connections per application
* **Capacity Planning:** Understand inter-subnet communication patterns
* **Security Analysis:** Detect unusual communication patterns

### Flow Aggregation Strategy

**Purpose:** Reduce data volume while preserving analytical value

**Benefits:**
* **Data Reduction:** Minimize export data volume  
* **Memory Efficiency:** Lower router memory requirements
* **Reliability:** Avoid packet loss during traffic spikes
* **Processing:** Router-side aggregation before analysis

**Challenge:** Building accurate traffic matrices remains a **non-trivial problem** requiring sophisticated aggregation and estimation techniques.

## Exam Preparation: Key Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Graph Theory Metrics Calculation

**Scenario:** Small network with 5 nodes (A, B, C, D, E)

**Connections:**
* A connects to: B, C
* B connects to: A, C, D  
* C connects to: A, B, D, E
* D connects to: B, C, E
* E connects to: C, D

**Calculate:**

1. **Degree Distribution P(k):**
   - Degree 2: A (1 node) → P(2) = 1/5 = 0.2
   - Degree 3: B, D, E (3 nodes) → P(3) = 3/5 = 0.6  
   - Degree 4: C (1 node) → P(4) = 1/5 = 0.2

2. **Clustering Coefficient for Node C:**
   - Neighbors: A, B, D, E (degree = 4)
   - Edges between neighbors: A-B, B-D, D-E = 3
   - CC = 2(3) / (4×3) = 6/12 = 0.5

3. **Network Diameter:**
   - Find all shortest paths, identify maximum
   - A to E: A→C→E (distance = 2)
   - All pairs have distance ≤ 2
   - Diameter = 2

### Example 2: Flow Analysis Scenario

**Given:** Router observes traffic for 1 hour with following flow data:

| Flow | Src IP | Dst IP | Protocol | Src Port | Dst Port | Bytes | Packets |
|------|--------|--------|----------|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| 1 | 10.1.1.5 | 192.168.1.10 | TCP | 12345 | 80 | 150MB | 120, 000 |
| 2 | 10.1.1.8 | 192.168.1.10 | TCP | 23456 | 80 | 75MB | 60, 000 |
| 3 | 10.1.1.5 | 192.168.1.20 | UDP | 34567 | 53 | 2MB | 1, 500 |

**Analysis Questions:**
1. **Application Breakdown:** How much web traffic (port 80)?
   - Web traffic = Flow 1 + Flow 2 = 150MB + 75MB = 225MB
   
2. **Flow Counting:** How many active web connections?
   - TCP port 80 connections = 2 flows

3. **Traffic Matrix (subnet level):**
   - 10.1.1.0/24 → 192.168.1.0/24: 227MB total
   - DNS queries: 2MB (UDP port 53)

**Key Insight:** Flow analysis provides detailed application visibility that SNMP counters cannot deliver.
