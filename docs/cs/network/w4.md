**Scenario**: Station A wants to send data to Station B

```
Step 1: Station A broadcasts RTS
A ----[RTS]----> B
  \             /
   \           /
    v         v
    C         D
(hears RTS,  (hears RTS,
 defers)      defers)

Step 2: Station B responds with CTS
A <---[CTS]----- B
  ^             ^
   \           /
    \         /
    C         D
(hears CTS,  (hears CTS,
 defers)      defers)

Step 3: Data transmission
A =====[DATA]===> B
(Other stations remain silent)
```

### Binary Exponential Backoff Calculation Example

| 2nd | 0 to 2^2-1 = [0, 3] | Random(0, 3) | 0μs, 20μs, 40μs, or 60μs |
| 3rd | 0 to 2^3-1 = [0, 7] | Random(0, 7) | 0μs to 140μs |
| nth | 0 to 2^n-1 | Random(0, 2^n-1) | Exponentially increasing |

### Common Exam Calculation Types

**1. Backoff Time Calculation**
Given: Collision attempt number n, slot time
Formula: Backoff window = [0, 2^n - 1]
Wait time = Random_slot × Slot_time

**2. Throughput Estimation**
Factors: Nominal bandwidth, interference level, distance, concurrent users
Real throughput ≈ Nominal × Efficiency_factor

**3. Range vs Power Trade-off**
Higher transmission power = Greater range but higher power consumption
Lower power (BLE) = Shorter range but extended battery life
