# 5.0 Network Layer

The Network Layer is a fundamental concept in computer networks, residing above the Data Link Layer and below the Transport Layer in the OSI model.

## Layer Comparison and Relationships

| Layer | Primary Focus | Scope | Key Protocols | Addressing |
|-------|--------------|-------|---------------|------------|
| Data Link Layer | Frame transmission across **single link** | Local (point-to-point) | Ethernet, PPP | MAC addresses |
| **Network Layer** | Packet delivery across **multiple networks** | End-to-end | **IP, ICMP** | **IP addresses** |
| Transport Layer | Reliable/unreliable data transfer | End-to-end | TCP, UDP | Port numbers |

**1. Role and Responsibilities**
*   The primary role of the Network Layer is to **get packets from a source host to a destination host**. This is a crucial distinction from the Data Link Layer, which is typically concerned with transmitting frames across a **single link**.
*   It is the **lowest OSI layer that has to deal with end-to-end transmission** across interconnected networks. Layers above it, like the Transport Layer, also deal with end-to-end communication.
*   The Network Layer must cater for packets traveling across **multiple networks**, which may be **different in technology, number, type, and topology** (e.g., combining Ethernet, Token Ring, fiber optics, satellite networks).
*   Key design objectives for an effective Network Layer include being **independent of processor/communication technology**, **independent of the number, type, and topology of the subnets**, and providing a **uniform addressing scheme for all hosts in the network**.

**2. Internet Protocol (IP)**
*   **IP** is the **main network layer protocol**. It is most widely used, typically **paired with TCP** (Transport Control Protocol).
*   IP runs on **all hosts and routers** in the network.
*   It is responsible for handling the **addressing and forwarding mechanisms**.
*   IP relays data across network boundaries and delivers packets from one host to another using IP addresses.

**3. IP Service Model (Focus on IPv4)**

### Service Characteristics Comparison

| Aspect | IPv4 Characteristics | Implications |
|--------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Connection Type** | Connectionless (datagram-based) | No connection establishment required |
| **Delivery Guarantee** | Best-effort (unreliable) | Packets may be lost, duplicated, delayed |
| **Ordering** | No guarantee | Packets may arrive out of order |
| **Error Recovery** | None at IP level | Higher layers (TCP) handle reliability |

*   The service model provided by IP (specifically IPv4) is **connectionless (datagram-based)**. This means a connection is not established beforehand; packets (datagrams) are simply sent out with destination information.
*   It provides **best-effort delivery**, meaning it is an **unreliable service**.
*   Due to this unreliable nature, packets may be **lost, delivered out of order, duplicated, or delayed** for a long time.
*   Despite being unreliable, this **best-effort service is still useful** in many scenarios.

**4. IPv4 Addressing**

### Address Structure and Classes

| Class | First Bits | Network Bits | Host Bits | Address Range | Max Networks | Max Hosts per Network |
|-------|------------|--------------|-----------|---------------|--------------|----------------------|
| **A** | 0 | 8 | 24 | 1.0.0.0 - 126.255.255.255 | 126 | 16, 777, 214 |
| **B** | 10 | 16 | 16 | 128.0.0.0 - 191.255.255.255 | 16, 384 | 65, 534 |
| **C** | 110 | 24 | 8 | 192.0.0.0 - 223.255.255.255 | 2, 097, 152 | 254 |

*   IP provides a **uniform addressing scheme** for all hosts, acting as a way of naming nodes.
*   IPv4 addresses are **32 bits (4 bytes)** long. They are commonly written in **dotted decimal notation**, where each byte is represented as a decimal number between 0 and 255, separated by dots (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
*   IPv4 addresses have a **basic hierarchical structure**, consisting of a **network part** and a **host part**. This is analogous to a postal address structure like country, city, street, and house number.
*   **IPv4 Address Classes (A, B, C)** were historically used, where the class and the default split between network and host parts were determined by the first few bits of the address.
    -   Class A: First bit is 0. Network part is the first 8 bits. Host part is the remaining 24 bits.
    -   Class B: First two bits are 10. Network part is the first 16 bits. Host part is the remaining 16 bits.
    -   Class C: First three bits are 110. Network part is the first 24 bits. Host part is the remaining 8 bits.

### Special Addresses

| Address Type | Description | Example (Class C) | Usable for Hosts |
|--------------|-------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Network Address** | All host bits = 0 | 192.168.1.0 | No |
| **Broadcast Address** | All host bits = 1 | 192.168.1.255 | No |
| **Host Addresses** | Mixed host bits | 192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1.254 | Yes |

*   Within any network or subnet, there are **special addresses**: the **network address** (all host bits are 0) and the **broadcast address** (all host bits are 1).
*   These two special addresses **reduce the number of usable host addresses** in a network or subnet. If a network/subnet has H bits for the host part, the number of usable host addresses is **2<sup>H</sup> - 2**.
*   An IP address assigned to a device connected to the internet must be **unique** on the internet. They can be assigned dynamically (e.g., when connecting to a network like UniFi).

**5. Subnetting (CIDR Basics)**

### Subnetting Example Calculation

**Scenario**: An ISP has been allocated 192.168.1.0/24 and needs to create 4 subnets.

| Subnet | Network Address | Subnet Mask | CIDR | Usable Range | Broadcast |
|--------|----------------|-------------|------|--------------|-----------|
| **1** | 192.168.1.0 | 255.255.255.192 | /26 | 192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1.62 | 192.168.1.63 |
| **2** | 192.168.1.64 | 255.255.255.192 | /26 | 192.168.1.65 - 192.168.1.126 | 192.168.1.127 |
| **3** | 192.168.1.128 | 255.255.255.192 | /26 | 192.168.1.129 - 192.168.1.190 | 192.168.1.191 |
| **4** | 192.168.1.192 | 255.255.255.192 | /26 | 192.168.1.193 - 192.168.1.254 | 192.168.1.255 |

**Calculation Process**:
* Original network: 192.168.1.0/24 (8 host bits)
* For 4 subnets: Need 2 additional bits (2² = 4)
* New subnet mask: /26 (24 + 2 = 26 network bits)
* Host bits per subnet: 6 bits (32 - 26 = 6)
* Hosts per subnet: 2⁶ - 2 = 62 usable addresses

### Subnet Mask Formats

| CIDR Notation | Dotted Decimal | Binary (last octet) | Host Bits | Max Hosts |
|---------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------|-----------|
| /24 | 255.255.255.0 | 00000000 | 8 | 254 |
| /25 | 255.255.255.128 | 10000000 | 7 | 126 |
| /26 | 255.255.255.192 | 11000000 | 6 | 62 |
| /27 | 255.255.255.224 | 11100000 | 5 | 30 |
| /28 | 255.255.255.240 | 11110000 | 4 | 14 |

*   **Subnetting** is a technique used to **divide a larger network into smaller, distinct subnetworks**. This is useful, for example, for an Internet Service Provider (ISP) to manage address space efficiently and distribute addresses to different customers or regions.
*   Subnetting is implemented using a **subnet mask**. The subnet mask is a 32-bit number, often written in dotted decimal notation or using slash notation (CIDR - Classless Interdomain Routing).
*   In the binary representation of a subnet mask, the bits that are part of the network/subnet address are set to **1**, and the bits that are part of the host address are set to **0**. The **ones always fill from the left** (most significant bit) to the right.
*   The slash notation (e.g.,      `/24`,      `/25`) indicates the **number of bits set to 1** in the subnet mask.
*   To determine if a destination IP address is on the same subnet as the sending host, the host performs a **bitwise AND operation** between its own subnet mask and the destination IP address. If the result equals the subnet number of the sending host, the destination is on the same subnet.

### Key Header Fields Comparison

| Field | Size (bits) | Purpose | Key Values | Impact of Errors |
|-------|-------------|---------|------------|------------------|
| **Version** | 4 | IP version identifier | 4 (IPv4) | Wrong protocol processing |
| **Header Length** | 4 | Header size in 32-bit words | 5-15 (20-60 bytes) | Parsing errors |
| **Total Length** | 16 | Entire packet size | 20-65535 bytes | Truncation/buffer issues |
| **TTL** | 8 | Hop limit | 1-255 | Routing loops prevention |
| **Protocol** | 8 | Upper layer protocol | 1(ICMP), 6(TCP), 17(UDP) | Wrong demultiplexing |
| **Header Checksum** | 16 | Error detection | Calculated value | Corruption detection |

### Fragmentation Control Fields

| Field | Purpose | Values | Fragment Handling |
|-------|---------|--------|------------------|
| **Identification** | Group fragments | 0-65535 | Same ID for all fragments of original packet |
| **DF Flag** | Don't Fragment | 0/1 | If 1, packet must not be fragmented |
| **MF Flag** | More Fragments | 0/1 | 1 for all fragments except last |
| **Fragment Offset** | Position in original | 0-8191 (×8 bytes) | Reassembly order indicator |

*   Every IP packet (datagram) carries an **IPv4 header** appended to the data payload from the upper layer. The header contains information needed to transfer the packet.
*   Understanding the fields in the IPv4 header is important. Key fields include:
    -   **Version**: Indicates the IP version (e.g., 4 for IPv4). (IPv6 exists but is excluded from the exam).
    -   **Header Length**: Specifies the length of the IP header in 32-bit units. A value greater than 5 implies the presence of the optional "Options" field.
    -   **Total Length**: The total length of the IP datagram (header + data).
    -   **Identification**: A value used to identify fragments belonging to the same original datagram.
    -   **Flags**: Contains control bits related to fragmentation, including "Don't Fragment" (DF) and "More Fragments" (MF) flags. The DF flag set to 1 tells routers not to fragment the packet.
    -   **Fragment Offset**: Indicates the position of a fragment relative to the beginning of the original unfragmented datagram. It is measured in units of 8 bytes.
    -   **Time To Live (TTL)**: A value that is decremented by each router (hop) the packet traverses. Its purpose is to **limit the lifetime of a packet** and prevent it from circulating endlessly in the network (e.g., due to routing loops). If TTL reaches zero, the packet is discarded.
    -   **Protocol Identifier**: Indicates the protocol used by the upper layer (e.g., TCP (6), UDP (17), ICMP (1)).
    -   **Header Checksum**: A checksum calculated **only over the IP header**. Its purpose is to **detect errors in the header** and ensure that routing information is correct. If due to error, the source or destination address changes, the packet would be misrouted.
    -   **Source IP Address**: The 32-bit IP address of the sending host.
    -   **Destination IP Address**: The 32-bit IP address of the intended receiving host.
    -   **Options and Padding**: Optional fields that can extend the header.

**7. Fragmentation and Reassembly**

### Fragmentation Example

**Original Packet**: 3000 bytes data + 20 bytes header = 3020 bytes total
**MTU Constraint**: 1500 bytes

| Fragment | Data Size | Total Size | Identification | MF Flag | Fragment Offset | Offset (bytes) |
|----------|-----------|------------|---------------|---------|----------------|----------------|
| **1** | 1480 bytes | 1500 bytes | 12345 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| **2** | 1480 bytes | 1500 bytes | 12345 | 1 | 185 | 1480 |
| **3** | 40 bytes | 60 bytes | 12345 | 0 | 370 | 2960 |

**Calculation Notes**:
* Fragment Offset = (Byte Offset) / 8
* Fragment 1: 0 / 8 = 0
* Fragment 2: 1480 / 8 = 185
* Fragment 3: 2960 / 8 = 370

### Fragmentation vs. Reassembly Comparison

| Aspect | Fragmentation | Reassembly |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| **Location** | Source host or intermediate routers | Destination host only |
| **Trigger** | Packet size > MTU | Receiving fragments |
| **Fields Used** | ID, DF, MF, Fragment Offset | ID, MF, Fragment Offset |
| **Error Handling** | Drop if DF=1 and size > MTU | Discard all if one fragment lost |
| **Performance Impact** | Processing overhead | Buffer management, timeout |

*   Messages may need to be **divided into smaller packets (fragments)** before transmission. This happens when a datagram is **larger than the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)** of the next network link it needs to traverse.
*   Fragmentation typically occurs at the source host or at intermediate routers if necessary.
*   The **Identification, Flags (MF), and Fragment Offset** fields in the IP header are used to manage fragmentation.
*   The "More Fragments" (MF) flag is set to 1 for all fragments except the last one. The "Fragment Offset" indicates the position of the fragment's data within the original datagram.
*   Fragments are **reassembled back into the original datagram at the destination host**. They are put together based on their Identification and Fragment Offset values, even if they arrive out of order.
*   IP itself **does not provide recovery for lost fragments**. If a fragment is lost, the entire original datagram cannot be reassembled, and a higher layer protocol (like TCP) would be responsible for requesting retransmission.
*   Sources generally **try to avoid fragmentation** due to the overhead involved. Re-fragmentation of an already fragmented packet is possible.

**8. Forwarding (vs Routing)**

### Forwarding vs. Routing Comparison

| Aspect | Forwarding | Routing |
|--------|------------|---------|
| **Scope** | Local router action | Network-wide process |
| **Function** | Move packet input → output port | Calculate/build forwarding tables |
| **Timeline** | Per-packet basis | Periodic or topology-change triggered |
| **Data Structure** | Uses existing forwarding table | Creates/updates forwarding table |
| **Location** | Individual router | Network control plane |
| **Speed Requirement** | Very fast (hardware-based) | Can be slower (software-based) |

### Example Forwarding Table

| Destination Network | Next Hop | Interface | Metric |
|-------------------|----------|-----------|--------|
| 192.168.1.0/24 | Direct | eth0 | 0 |
| 192.168.2.0/24 | 10.0.0.1 | eth1 | 1 |
| 0.0.0.0/0 | 10.0.0.254 | eth1 | 10 |

*   **Forwarding** is the **local action taken by a router** to move a packet from an input interface to an output interface.
*   A router determines the appropriate output port by **looking up the destination IP address** of the incoming packet in its forwarding table.
*   (While related, the process of *creating* or *calculating* these forwarding/routing tables is called Routing, which is an excluded topic).
